    // What is Redis ?

    /*
        Redis is an open-source, in-memory data store that can be used as a cache,
        database, and message broker. It's known for its speed, reliability,
        and performance.

        Redis stores data in memory instead of on a disk, which makes it faster.
        Redis supports complex data types like strings, hashes, lists, sets, and JSON.
        Redis has built-in replication and persistence capabilities.
        Redis offers built-in Lua scripting.

     Redis use cases
        Redis is used as a cache to improve application performance.
        Redis can be used as a database to store and manipulate data.
        Redis can be used as a message broker.

     Redis features
        Redis supports multiple levels of on-disk persistence.
        Redis offers high availability.
        Redis supports data replication.
        Redis supports atomic operations on data types.
        Redis supports bitfields, which can efficiently encode multiple counters in a string.
