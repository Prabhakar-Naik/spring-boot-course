    // What is KAFKA ?

    /*
        Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform designed
        to handle high-throughput, low-latency data streams.

        Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform primarily used for building
        real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It allows you to publish,
        subscribe to, store, and process streams of records (messages or events) in a
        fault-tolerant, scalable, and high-throughput manner.

        Kafka is designed to handle data that is constantly being generated and needs
        to be processed as it comes in, without delays.

        Here are some key aspects of Kafka:

        Messaging System:
        Kafka works as a publish-subscribe messaging system, allowing
        applications to communicate by producing and consuming messages (or events).

        Event Streaming:
        Kafka is designed to handle streams of data, meaning it can
        process events in real-time as they occur.

        Topics and Partitions:
        In Kafka, data is categorized into topics, and each
        topic can be further divided into partitions for scalability and performance.
        Producers publish messages to a topic, and consumers read from it.

        Durability:
        Kafka retains messages for a configurable period, even after theyâ€™ve been
        consumed, which allows consumers to process the same messages at different times.

        Scalability:
        Kafka can handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally by
        adding more brokers to the cluster.

        Kafka is widely used in scenarios like log aggregation, real-time analytics,
        monitoring, and stream processing applications. It is highly adopted in modern
        architectures like microservices and event-driven systems.
