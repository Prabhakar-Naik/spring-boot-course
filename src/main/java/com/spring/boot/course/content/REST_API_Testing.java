    // What is API Testing?
    /**
     * API testing is a type of software testing that focuses on
     * verifying the functionality, reliability, performance, and
     * security of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
     * Unlike traditional GUI testing.
     * API testing involves sending requests to the API and validating the responses,
     * without interacting with the user interface.
     * */

    // Key Principles of API Testing
    /**
     * API testing is crucial in modern software development as it ensures that
     * different software systems can communicate and exchange data accurately
     * and securely. It helps identify issues early in the development process,
     * reducing the risk of bugs and improving the overall quality of the application.
     */

    // Types of API Testing
    /**
     * Functional Testing: Validates that the API functions as expected for various input conditions.
     * Load Testing: Checks the API's performance under high traffic conditions.
     * Security Testing: Ensures the API is protected against vulnerabilities.
     * End-to-End Testing: Validates the entire workflow involving multiple API calls.
     * Contract Testing: Ensures that the API adheres to the defined contract or specification

    // HTTP STATUS CODE:
    /**
     * An HTTP status code is a three-digit numeric code returns by a web server as
     * part of the response to an HTTP request made by a client.
     * These status codes are used to convey information about the result or status
     * of the requested operation.

     Status Code Series:
     *         100 - 199  ==> Informational response
     *         200 - 299  ==> Successful response
     *         300 - 399  ==> Redirection messages
     *         400 - 499  ==> Client Error
     *         500 - 599  ==> Server Error
